What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A '.git' file is created and a tracking system is enabled where we can track the history of the files inside the git initialized folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It acts as a buffer so that we can group/choose files before making a commit.
