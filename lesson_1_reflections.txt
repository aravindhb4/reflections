How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It is really useful. Rather than wasting time going thru the whole code, it shows exactly what i want.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps to fallback to safe version of my code and  also compare the growth so far.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Choosing manually helps to have control over the file we are working on and keep track ourselves.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Tracking multiple files at once is a good option so that files that work together stays together during changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Git log shows us the full history of the file with commit ids. And git diff can be used to view any changes between two commits using the commit ids.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Now i can experiment freely having known that i can fallback to my last successful code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Almost everything.
